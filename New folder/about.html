            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Pudgy Penguins, a creative venture founded in 2021, quickly gained attention for its unique brand and engaging content. In 2022, the company was acquired by Igloo Inc., a move strategically aimed at expanding its reach and capabilities. The acquisition by Igloo Inc. was part of a broader vision to overhaul and reposition Pudgy Penguins as a major player in the entertainment industry, focusing on character-driven narratives.</p>
            <p>Under this new leadership, the company is set to create a diverse range of content, products, and experiences, all derived from the rich and whimsical universe of Pudgy Penguins. This transformation is expected to leverage the original charm of the brand while introducing innovative approaches to storytelling and product development.</p>
